# This script calculates take-home pay for a given CTC, for both an employee and a consultant.
#
# Assumptions:
#  1) GST comes out of your pocket — you can't pass the GST along by grossing it up.
#  2) This is for fiscal year 2019-20.
#  3) You're a resident individual of India, not a company.
#  4) You're not a senior citizen.
#  5) Numbers are annual, and in thousands of rupees, except when stated otherwise. Take-home pay
#     is always monthly.
#  6) This script doesn't take into account the cost in your time of dealing with the bureaucratic
#     GST regime, or the cost of hiring a CA to do so.
#  7) GST paid can't be set off against something else.
#  8) HRA and LTA are ignored.
