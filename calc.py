This script calculates marginal tax for consultants: if you want to earn a given amount of net
income, how much gross fee should you quote a client, considering income tax? And if you already
have a client for a given gross fee, how much net income will you earn from it?

Assumptions:
 - This is for fiscal year 2021-22.
 - You're a resident individual of India or an LLP.
 - You're not a senior citizen.
 - Professional tax is ignored since it's a fixed tax rather than a percentage tax, so the next
   client won't result in any extra professional tax.
 - Your income from other clients is enough to put you in the 30% slab, so each marginal rupee is
   taxed at 30%.
 - Your taxable income does not exceed 50 lakh, so surcharge does not apply.
 - GST is not included because it's zero-rated for foreign clients. (Even for Indian clients,
   it's typically passed on to clients over and above the quoted fee).
